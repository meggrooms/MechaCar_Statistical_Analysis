# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
### <strong>Project Overview:</strong>
<BR>


Plagued by production issues, AutosRUs needs to determine the problems with manufacturing their new prototype, the MechaCar. I wanted to know how the each manufacturing lot compared to the others, and look at the specifications to narrow down the exact production issue. I was able to determine that the issues are largely related to one of the manufacturing lots, what follows is my presentation to the board.
<br>

### <strong> Metrics to be tested</strong>

• Fuel efficiency per test vehicle for city & highway driving
<BR> 
• PSI comparison per test vehicle
<br>
• Performance of each manufacturing lot
<BR>
<br>  
#### Processes used to prepare the analysis:<br>
• A linear regression analysis was perfromed to identify which variables could predict the mpg of the prototype
<BR>
• Analyze statistics on the PSI of the suspensin coils from each manufacturing lot
<br>

 #### Linear Regression Model to Predict MPG

The goal is to see a 95% confidence rate in the statistics, meaning a p-value of 0.05.   
  
  

 
The slope of the linear model is not zero, according to the statistical summary results. Assuming we have a confidence level of 95%, the p-value is far below the corresponding .05 significance level and, therefore, we have sufficient statistical reasoning to reject the null hypothesis that the slope is zero
