# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
### <strong>Project Overview:</strong>
<BR>


Plagued by production issues, AutosRUs needs to determine the problems with manufacturing their new prototype, the MechaCar. I wanted to know how the each manufacturing lot compared to the others, and look at the specifications to narrow down the exact production issue. I was able to determine that the issues are largely related to one of the manufacturing lots, what follows is my presentation to the board.

### <strong> Metrics to be tested</strong>

This statistical analysis will measue the following:
<br>
• Fuel efficiency per test vehicle for city & highway driving
<BR> 
• PSI comparison per test vehicle
<br>
• Performance of each manufacturing lot
